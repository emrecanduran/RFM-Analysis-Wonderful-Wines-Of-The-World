### RFM-Analysis-Wonderful-Wines-Of-The-World

## WonderfulWines Data

New Super Markets International (NEW SMI) is a well-established grocery store chain that has been operating for fifty years in Portugal. Its primary goal is to offer customers convenient and affordable shopping experiences.

To meet the evolving needs of its customers, NEW SMI has implemented both traditional brick-and-mortar stores as well as electronic channels, including a website and a mobile app. This allows customers to make purchases through their preferred channels, whether it be in-store or online.

Although NEW SMI has been building a data warehouse for the past ten years, it has predominantly relied on mass marketing strategies without implementing loyalty programs or identifying target markets for cross-selling opportunities. However, NEW SMI now intends to leverage its database more effectively by adopting a customer-centric approach and developing focused marketing programs.

As part of this initiative, NEW SMI has provided a customer-signature table consisting of 9,000 randomly selected customers who made purchases from NEW SMI during 2021. The objective is to develop an actionable and methodically sound customer-based segmentation strategy.

Please note that the proposed segmentation strategy will utilize the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model to analyze customer behavior and tailor marketing efforts accordingly. 

## RFM Model

The RFM model, which stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value, is a powerful customer segmentation technique commonly used in marketing and business analytics.
